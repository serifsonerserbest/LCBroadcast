## Project Description

The goal of this practical project is to implement the building blocks necessary
for implementing a decentralized payment system. To this end, we used some underlying
abstractions:

- Perfect Links
- Uniform Reliable Broadcast
- FIFO(First In First Out) Broadcast
- Localized Causal Broadcast
