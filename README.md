# Localized Causal Broadcast for Decentralized Payment System

This project is a part of the the 'Distributed Algorithms' course at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). Detail about the course can be found [here](http://dcl.epfl.ch/site/education/da).

The goal of this practical project is to implement the building blocks necessary
for implementing a decentralized payment system. To this end, we used some underlying
abstractions:

- Perfect Links
- Uniform Reliable Broadcast
- FIFO(First In First Out) Broadcast
- Localized Causal Broadcast
